## More details on recent history

In 2013, Sarah served as a [Presidential Innovation Fellow at the Smithsonian Institution](http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/smithsonian-welcomes-presidential-innovation-fellows). The Presidential Innovation Fellowship was established by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in 2012 to pair industry experts with government innovators. The Smithsonian is one of several agencies sponsoring fellows in support of the Administration's Open Data initiative. This spring, President Barack Obama signed an Executive Order establishing the Open Data Policy to make information generated and stored by the federal government more open and accessible, with the goals of increasing government transparency and efficiency and fueling entrepreneurship and economic growth.  In 2014, she  joined the founding team at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/), and worked for two years to transform US Government digital services from the inside-out, practicing human-centered design and agile development, with open source solutions.

In 2009, Sarah founded the innovative product strategy, design &amp; development company, [Blazing Cloud](http://blazingcloud.net), where she articulated an agile/lean UX methodology known as the Blazing Path. The company is not actively accepting new clients, since the team joined Indiegogo in 2013.

Sarah believes that open source software provides solid technical foundations and compelling business models.  She is expert with Ruby and Rails and was a member of the [OpenLaszlo](http://www.openlaszlo.org) core team, where she coded in asynchronous Javascript before it was cool.
